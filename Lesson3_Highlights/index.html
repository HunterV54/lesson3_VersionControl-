            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is used mostly as a project management system, people can edit and change as the please to a project/software or webpage.  Using a version control system is beneficial in many ways. First of all, when editing a project file, it can keep the original incase the new edited project has an error.  “something to fall back on to” many companies use this to insure a major update or software change they have a back up plan.     </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Github is one of the most popular Version control systems.  This came to be by a person name Linus Torvalds.  Yes, the same person who is the inventor of Linux.  He made this to help him on his open source software stance and everyone who was with him.  It gave them all a means of sharing programs/apps and helping each other no matter where they were in the world. Github useless a repository

            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> Java script is a scripting language it is used to enhance HTML webpages.  The code can either be integrated into the HTML code or in a separate file and be referenced in the code.  Because the code is an interpreted language it does not to need to be compiled like regular java.  Java script is a great tool to have for a web developer the power java script has to make your site so much more dynamic and original giving you almost endless options to designing.

</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git has many commands you can use for various tasks. Git init is what you first use to open the repository.  Then, commit this is taking a type of preview snap shot of the work, before you begin to push it into the repo.  Push is used after the commit; it updates the repository.  Git add command comes before git commit and it starts the repository so you can add the files to it.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> From Version control to Github to JavaScript.  They may seam small when looked at invaluably but when combined, you can have a huge network.  Hundreds of thousands of people using each one of these everyday (as a job) and millions using the work of someone who use them to create a website or program. They are used in everyday things even when you do not realize it. That is why it is important to have the tools and know how to better yourself in your chosen carrier field.
